## 1. General Requirements (Feature requirements)

- User can send and receive messages
- User can attach medias to messages
  - video
  - audio
  - pictures
  - location
- User can see contact list
- User can share messages

### 2. Specific Requirements (Functional requirements, Platforms, Target Browsers, etc.)

- Low latency for messages (real-time, 40-60ms)
- App should work in short network band (mobile devices)
- App should not waste resource (battery life)
- Focus on traffic and resources
- App should work on a wide range of devices

## 3. Component Architechture

```TSX
<ChatApp>
  <ContactList>
    <SearchBox/>
    <Contact/>
    <Contact/>
  </ContactList>
  <ChatView>
    <MessageList>
      <Message>
        <MessageActions /> // reply, copy, share, delete
      </Message>
      <Message>
        <AttachmentList>
          <Attachment/>
          <Attachment/>
        </AttachmentList>
        <MessageActions />
      </Message>
    </MessageList>
    <Controls>
      <Input/>
      <InputActions/> // media, emoji, quick photo, record audio
    </Controls>
  </ChatView>
</ChatApp>
```

## 4. Data API and protocol

- Date API

  ```typescript
  declare function subscribeForMessage(
    apiKey: string,
    userId: number
  ): Promise<void>;

  declare function getContacts(
    apiKey: string,
    userId: number
  ): Promise<ContactDto[]>;

  declare function attachMedia(
    apiKey: string,
    userId: number,
    messageId: number,
    data: string // binary
  ): Promise<void>;

  declare function sendMessage(
    apiKey: string,
    userId: number,
    message: IMessage
  ): Promise<void>;
  ```

- ### Protocol
  - Long polling
    - Pros.
      - HTTP benefits
      - Easy implementation
    - Cons.
      - When moving, network cell changes often, increases latency
      - Connections can timeout caused by certain proxies
      - Large traffic overhead, always send full request, incl. header, token, etc
  - WebSockets
    - Pros.
      - Duplex, bi-directional client-server communication
      - Super low latency
    - Cons.
      - Constant TCP connection is expensive from resource perspective
      - Not HTTP2 compatible
        - We have to manually do optimization that comes for free in HTTP2 protocol
          - Asset zipping
          - Multiplexing
      - Hard to load balance
        - Usually server has proxies and firefalls, they can sometimes filter TCP traffic, and re-connecting WebSockets is not a trivial to do in production
        - Creating additional infrastructure that needs to be maintained
        - Costing additional resources
  - Server Sent Events
    - Pros.
      - HTTP2 compatible
        - More scalable
        - Asset zipping
        - Caching
        - Multiplexing
      - Don't transfer unneccessary data, no headers, tokens, cookies, etc.
      - SSE doesn't waste device resources, doesn't drain battery life
      - Easier to load balance. Because HTTP2 enables multiplexing, it allows the client to receive data from different server nodes without breaking the connection with load balancer
    - Cons.
      - Weird API
      - Uni-directional, server to client only
      - Only text data, needs additional parsing on the frontend
    - How to communicate client to server if using SSE?
      - Server to client -> SSE
      - Client to server -> HTTP POST request (traffic overhead is one trade-off)

## 5. Data Entities and Store

```typescript
interface IContact {
  id: number;
  name: string;
}

interface IMessage {
  id: number;
  content: string;
  attachments?; IAttachment[];
  authorId: number;
  receiverId: number;
  timestamp: number;
}

interface IAttachment {
  id: number;
  messageId:number;
  type: 'link' | 'video' | 'audio'; // ...etc
  url: string
}
```

```typescript
interface IContactStore {
  [cid in string]: IContact;
}
interface IMessageStore {
  [cid in string]: IMessage[];
}
interface IAttachmentStore {
  [mid in string]: IAttachment[];
}
```

```TSX
<ChatApp> // single fetching point
  <ContactList cids={["a","b"]}> // look up ContactStore
    <SearchBox/>
    <Contact cid="a" /> // look up ContactStore
    <Contact cid="b" />
  </ContactList>
  <ChatView>
    <MessageList cid="a"> // look up MessageStore
      <Message>
        <MessageActions /> // reply, copy, share, delete
      </Message>
      <Message>
        <AttachmentList mid="a"> // look up AttachmentStore
          <Attachment/>
          <Attachment/>
        </AttachmentList>
        <MessageActions />
      </Message>
    </MessageList>
    <Controls>
      <Input/>
      <InputActions/> // media, emoji, quick photo, record audio
    </Controls>
  </ChatView>
</ChatApp>
```

## 6. Optimization

- Network performance
  - GZIP (50% smaller)
  - Brotli (70% smaller)
  - HTTP2 Protocol
    - Enabls multiplexing
      - Fetch multiple resources in parallel under one connection
      - Don't have to bundle the app in a single file
  - code splitting
    - Vendor Bundle
    - Chat Bundle
    - ES6 Bundle
      - For modern browsers, so we don't need to ship extra polyfills
  - Images
    - Webp format for browsers that support it, fallback to png
    - Image optimizaion service
      - Send viewport size along with the image url as query string
      - https://company-img-123.png?viewport=300x300
      - The service returns optimized image of appropriate size
      - Cache and serve the images from CDN (viewport size don't change that often) Content lives closer to user
  - Resource minification
  - Non-critical resources
    - Load asynchronously with link rel="preload"
  - Efficient caching policy
    - Etag
    - Last modified date
- Rendering performance
  - Inline critical resources
  - Defer loading of non-critical resources
  - Defer loading of analytic resources
  - Use CSS animation instead of JavaScript to avoid reflow(whole page re-render)
  - Cumulative layout shift (CLS)
    - Pre-define image height and width to prevent layout shifts when image is loaded
  - DOM performance
    - List virtualization
      - Use constant number of nodes for list elements
      - Replace data on the list elements when we need to display need data
- JavaScript performance
  - prevent operations from blocking UI interactions(single threaded)
    - Use promise/async to run operations that takes time
    - Cache results of heavy computation
      - Web Workers
      - WASM
- PWA (offline access)
  - Use service workers to cache bundles
    - chat.js
    - chat.css
    - Messages data
    - Messages media content

## 7. Accessbility

- Use rem units instead of px, adapts to browser zoom and customer font sizes
- Hotkeys
  - Next contact
  - Previous contact
  - Procees to message view
  - Attach media
  - Search
  - Help menu
- Provide color scheme variations for different types of color blindness
- Provide proper aria-roles and attributes for custom components
  - aria-haspopup to announce the element can load another layer
  - All inputs elements should have aria-live attribute. So assistive technology can inform user of content change
- All images have valid alt text
- Semantic HTML structure
