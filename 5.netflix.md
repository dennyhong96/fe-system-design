### 4. Data Entities

```typescript
interface IMovie {
  id: number;
  previewUrl: string; // short preview
  title: string;
  description: string;
  tags: ITag[];
  episodes: IEpisode[];
  rating: number;
  cast: IActor[];
}

interface IEpisode {
  id: number;
  movieId: number;
  url: string[]; // array for different qualities
  previewUrl: string; // short preview
  title: string;
  description: string;
  tags: ITag[];
}

interface IActor {
  id: number;
  fullName: string;
  imageUrl: string;
}

type MovieGridMap = Map<string, IMovie[]>; // tagId -> movies
```

### 5. Data API and protocol

- REST
  - Less Agile, need extra filters/endpoints to get the fields we need
  - Very scalable becuase we have advantage of the HTTP architecture such as HTTP caching by default
- GraphQL
  - More Agile, able to easily select the fields we need from the client. Useful for multi-level data
  - No HTTP caching, because GraphQL always use POST request

```typescript
declare function getMovieGrid(
  apiKey: string,
  userId: number
): Promise<MovieGridMap>;

declare function searchForMovies(
  apiKey: string,
  userId: number,
  query: string,
  tags: ITag[],
  pageSize: number,
  pageNumber: number
): Promise<IMovie[]>;
```

### 6. Store Normalization

```typescript
interface IMovieStore {
  [movieId: number]: IMovie;
}
interface IEpisodeStore {
  [movieId: number]: IEpisode[];
}
interface IMovieGridStore {
  [tagId: number]: IMovie[];
}
interface ISearchStore {
  [movieId: number]: IMovie;
}
```

```TSX
    <MainPage> // Fetch Movie grid
      {!isSearchMode && (
        <PromoMoview>
          <PlayBtn />
          <MoreInfoBtn />
      </PromoMoview>
      )}
      <MovieCardsRow tagId> // Access IMovieGridStore
        <MovieCard movieId> // Access IMovieStore
          {isHovered && (
            <MoviewPreview>
              <Video/>
              <ActionButtons />
              <MoreInfoBtn />
              {isFullInfo && (
                <>
                <EpisodeList movieId /> // Access IEpisodeStore
                <MoreLikeThis />
                </>
              )}
            </MoviewPreview>
          )}
        </MovieCard>
        // ...
      </MovieCardsRow>
      <MovieCardsRow tagId />
      <MovieCardsRow tagId />
    </MainPage>
```

### 7. Optimization

- Network performance
  - Gzip 30% - 50%
  - Brotli 40% - 70%
  - HTTP2 is important
    - Serive application from server that supports HTTP2 multiplexing
    - We can stream many resources in parallel
    - We can as many parallel connection as we can have
  - Webp images, fallback to png
  - Promo short videos
    - Videos can take lots of traffic, use gifs for short promo videos
  - Load movie detail lazily, only when the more information button is clicked
  - Bundle splitting
    - Enabled by HTTP2 multiplexing
      - vendors.js
      - player.js - lazy load
      - profile.js
      - signup.js
      - movieGrid.js
      - ES6 bundle for Smart TV that runs on Chromium, no need to polyfill
  - Images
    - Serve Webp format, with PNG fallback
    - Image optimization service
      - We don't want to serve full sized image to users on small devices and slow networks.
      - Send viewport size along with the image url as query string
      - https://movie-1234.webp?viewport=300x300
      - Put a CDN on top of the image optimization service
        - Viewport size doesn't change often, cached image will be used most of the time
        - reduce the times of Image optimization service beding called
        - serve images at CDN node that is cloest to user
    - Lazy load image with intersection observer
  - Effective browser level caching
    - Etag
- JavaScript performance
  - prevent operations from blocking UI interactions(single threaded)
    - Use promise/async to run operations that takes time
    - Cache results of heavy computation
    - Delegate heavy computation to Web Workers in background
    - Use high performence library written in WASM
  - Minimize the code
- Rendering performance
  - SSR
    - Decrease time to first content
    - Decrase time to first interaction
  - Inline critical js and css
  - Load non-critical resources later
    - analytics.js
  - Use preload tag to preload other pages that are usually viewed together with current page
    - Less likely to block the page's render, improving performance
  - Use placeholder/skeletons for movie card
    - Inform user loading is in progress
    - In certain cases, this can decrease perceived loading time by users
    - Improves user experience
  - Implement animation/transitions on paint -> composition level
    - Use CSS transforms
    - Does not trigger reflows
- PWA (offline access)
  - Register sercie workers to cache
    - MoviesGrid.js
    - MoviesGrid.css
    - Last movies data
    - Movie images/promo gif

### 8. Accessbility

- Use rem units instead of px, adapts to browser zoom and customer font sizes
- Provide proper aria-roles and attributes for custom components
  - aria-haspopup to announce the element can load another layer
  - All inputs elements should have aria-live attribute. So assistive technology can inform user of content change
- Provide user with subtitles of movies
  - Should be accesible to screen readers as well
- Multiple color schemes for different types of color blindness
- Hotkeys
  - Navigation
    - Movies
    - Genres
- Search movies
- Open movie details
- Movie actions menu
- Help menu
